//! Core big-integer algorithms.
//!
//! This crate implements the fundamental arithmetic algorithms — addition, subtraction,
//! multiplication and division — operating on sequences of [`Digit`]s.
//!
//! Numbers are represented as slices of [`Digit`]s in little-endian order — the
//! least-significant digit first — regardless of the platform's native byte order (so the
//! layout is the same on big-endian machines).
//!
//! Function names describe each operand explicitly. The
//! operand vocabulary is:
//!
//! * `unsigned` — a slice of digits interpreted as an unsigned (non-negative) value
//! * `signed` — a slice of digits interpreted as a signed value (always two's complement)
//! * `digit` — a single [`Digit`]
//! * `sdigit` — a single [`SignedDigit`]
//! * `carry` — a `bool` carry (0 or 1)
//! * `scarry` — a [`SignedDigit`] carry (-1, 0, or 1)
//! * `borrow` — a `bool` borrow (0 or 1)
